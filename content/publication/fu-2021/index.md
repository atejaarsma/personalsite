abstract: The emergence and re-emergence of viral epidemics and the risks of antiviral
  drug resistance are a serious threat to global public health. New options to supplement
  or replace currently used drugs for antiviral therapy are urgently needed. The research
  in the field of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides
  (RiPPs) has been booming in the last few decades, in particular in view of their
  strong antimicrobial activities and high stability. The RiPPs with antiviral activity,
  especially those against enveloped viruses, are now also gaining more interest.
  RiPPs have a number of advantages over small molecule drugs in terms of specificity
  and affinity for targets, and over protein-based drugs in terms of cellular penetrability,
  stability and size. Moreover, the great engineering potential of RiPPs provides
  an efficient way to optimize them as potent antiviral drugs candidates. These intrinsic
  advantages underscore the good therapeutic prospects of RiPPs in viral treatment.
  With the aim to highlight the underrated antiviral potential of RiPPs and explore
  their development as antiviral drugs, we review the current literature describing
  the antiviral activities and mechanisms of action of RiPPs, discussing the ongoing
  efforts to improve their antiviral potential and demonstrate their suitability as
  antiviral therapeutics. We propose that antiviral RiPPs may overcome the limits
  of peptide-based antiviral therapy, providing an innovative option for the treatment
  of viral disease.
