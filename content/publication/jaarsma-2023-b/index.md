abstract: 'The microbiome of Greenland Ice Sheet supraglacial habitats is still underinvestigated,
  and as a result there is a lack of representative genomes from these environments.
  In this study, we investigated the supraglacial microbiome through a combination
  of culturing-dependent and -independent approaches. We explored ice, cryoconite,
  biofilm, and snow biodiversity to answer: (1) how microbial diversity differs between
  supraglacial habitats, (2) if obtained bacterial genomes reflect dominant community
  members, and (3) how culturing versus high throughput sequencing changes our observations
  of microbial diversity in supraglacial habitats. Genomes acquired through metagenomic
  sequencing (133 high-quality MAGs) and whole genome sequencing (73 bacterial isolates)
  were compared to the metagenome assemblies to investigate abundance within the total
  environmental DNA. Isolates obtained in this study were not dominant taxa in the
  habitat they were sampled from, in contrast to the obtained MAGs. We demonstrate
  here the advantages of using metagenome SSU rRNA genes to reflect whole-community
  diversity. Additionally, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of the application of
  in situ culturing in a supraglacial setting.'
