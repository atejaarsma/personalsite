abstract: The Greenland Ice Sheet is a biome which is mainly microbially driven. Several
  different niches can be found within the glacial biome for those microbes able to
  withstand the harsh conditions, e.g., low temperatures, low nutrient conditions,
  high UV radiation in summer, and contrasting long and dark winters. Eukaryotic algae
  can form blooms during the summer on the ice surface, interacting with communities
  of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Cryoconite holes and snow are also habitats with
  their own microbial community. Nevertheless, the microbiome of supraglacial habitats
  remains poorly studied, leading to a lack of representative genomes from these environments.
  Under-investigated extremophiles, like those living on the Greenland Ice Sheet,
  may provide an untapped reservoir of chemical diversity that is yet to be discovered.
  In this study, an inventory of the biosynthetic potential of these organisms is
  made, through cataloging the presence of biosynthetic gene clusters in their genomes.
  There were 133 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and 28 whole genomes
  of bacteria obtained from samples of the ice sheet surface, cryoconite, biofilm,
  and snow using culturing-dependent and -independent approaches. AntiSMASH and BiG-SCAPE
  were used to mine these genomes and subsequently analyze the resulting predicted
  gene clusters. Extensive sets of predicted Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs) were
  collected from the genome collection, with limited overlap between isolates and
  MAGs. Additionally, little overlap was found in the biosynthetic potential among
  different environments, suggesting specialization of organisms in specific habitats.
  The median number of BGCs per genome was significantly higher for the isolates compared
  to the MAGs. The most talented producers were found among Proteobacteria. We found
  evidence for the capacity of these microbes to produce antimicrobials, carotenoid
  pigments, siderophores, and osmoprotectants, indicating potential survival mechanisms
  to cope with extreme conditions. The majority of identified BGCs, including those
  in the most prevalent gene cluster families, have unknown functions, presenting
  a substantial potential for bioprospecting. This study underscores the diverse biosynthetic
  potential in Greenland Ice Sheet genomes, revealing insights into survival strategies
  and highlighting the need for further exploration and characterization of these
  untapped resources.
